This is a great room for long stays as you have the comfort of a living area as well as privacy due to its location in the house. We have a Sofa Bed in this room so that we can accommodate a family of 4 or 4 adults in 2 double beds. The Suite features a small, quiet, cosy bedroom located away from the other guest rooms.
