Many times we have watched the deer in our rear gardens from this room as they wander between the houses on their way from Rockwood Park. This large bedroom room in the middle of the house offers a Private Bathroom and a walk-in closet with a Queen Sleigh Bed. There is a large dresser and mirror and a great old fireplace. We think of this room as one in which to relax and unwind. All our rooms are located upstairs and we also have a relaxing Sitting Room at the end of the hall to read, chat or just unwind.

**Room Features.**

* Netflix
* Radio Alarm
* Queen Bed
* Private 4 piece Bathroom across the hall
