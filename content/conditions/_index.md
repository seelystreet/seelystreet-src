We pride ourselves on having a clean, safe and welcoming environment for our guests, however, we have enhanced our already vigorous cleaning regime within the Bed & Breakfast as follows:

1. All door handles/knobs, countertops, chairs, light switches, and furniture will be cleaned, disinfected twice a day in public areas.
1. Guest bedrooms and bathrooms will be deep cleaned after each guest stay.
1. Please remove your shoes when entering into our B&B - we do provide booties for you to use.
1. Client Responsibilily We rely on you, our clients, to share the responsibility for the health and wellbeing of our other guests and my wife & I. If you are sick or are showing symptoms of illness please cancel your stay and rebook when you are healthy.
